# CodeLite Release Notes - v19.0.0

## Major Improvements

### AI-Powered Release Notes Generation

* Improved Git view notebook styling with reduced border size
* Implemented native notebook for the changes view in Git

### Improved LLM Integration
* Introduced `LLMManager` helpers for model handling (`GetModels`, `SetModels`, `GetActiveModel`) and interrupt support (`Interrupt`, `CheckInterrupted`)
* Updated `ChatAIWindow` to include `LLMManager` and switch debug logging to trace

### Code Modernization & Cleanup
